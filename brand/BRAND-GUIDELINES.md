# Uplift Brand Guidelines

## Version 1.0 — January 2026

---

## Brand Essence

**Uplift exists to show frontline workers where they can go.**

We're not scheduling software. We're a career platform for the 80% of workers that LinkedIn forgot.

---

## Brand Promise

**"Your next move."**

Every interaction with Uplift should reinforce this promise. We help workers see their path forward.

## Logo: The Rising U

### Concept

The Uplift mark is a stylized "U" with the right stem rising at 45° and an arrow point.

- **Left stem:** Where you are — grounded, stable, your foundation
- **Right stem:** Where you're going — rising, momentum, growth
- **Arrow point:** The breakthrough moment — promotion, opportunity, next move

### Construction

The mark is built on a simple principle: a letter that's going somewhere.

### Files

| File | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `uplift-app-icon.svg` | App stores, home screens |
| `uplift-favicon.svg` | Browser tabs (16-64px) |

| `uplift-logo-full-white.svg` | Dark backgrounds |
| `uplift-mark-orange.svg` | In-app navigation, watermarks |
| `uplift-logo-clean.svg` | Standalone mark usage |

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "U" stem on all sides.

### Minimum Size

- Full logo: 120px wide minimum
- Mark only: 24px minimum
- App icon: Works at all standard sizes (16px to 1024px)
